# Computer Science Illuminated Chapter 1

This blog is my first computer science blog and I wanted something with the breadth of the entire field to serve as an introduction.

Before getting into the first chapter, I think it's a good idea to understand the background of the book before actually delving inside the content. The authors of this book are John Lewis (born: 25/08/1963) from Virgina Tech. 
Funnily from his Wikipedia page [[1]](#1)
