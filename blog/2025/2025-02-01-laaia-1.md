## Introduction
This is just my sparse notes as I was only trying to fill in the gaps from my course last semester.

## How do elementary row operations yield the same system of linear equations?
1. Row swapping is trivial to prove
2. Row scaling is only just multiplying both sides of the equation by some scalar and also is quite trivial to see that it is the same line. $x+1=y$ is equivalent to $2x+2=2y$ as it still has the **same solution set.**
3. Row addition of another scaled row is also just adding the equivalent values on the LHS and RHS of the equations. For example,
$$
2x + 4y = 14 \\
5x + 2y = 19 \\

2x + 4y + 19 = 14 + 19 \\ 
2x + 4y + (5x+2y) = 14 + 19 \\
7x + 6y = 33
$$

The above explanation was from maths stack exchange. This changed my perspective on row addition being just balancing the equation on either side and if scaling the row being added, this just calls on the reasoning of *point 2* which states that this is just an equivalent line.

Another explanation uses the PLU decomposition where multiplying invertible matrices of the corresponding row operations and "inversing" them to get the decomposition which is just the equivalent operations in matrix form.

Furthermore, each of these linear equation can be seen as a line (for bivariate cases) and using point 3 **does change** the actual line into another line **however** the solution set is still **the same** with different linear equations. *Points 1 and 2* don't suffer these as they don't change the overall behaviour of the linear equation. 

## Definitions
Two linear systems are *equivalent* if they have the same solution sets and two matrices are *row equivalent* if there is a sequence of elementary row operations that transforms one matrix into another. Elementary row operations are reversible so this *"row equivalence"* goes both ways.
