# Computer Science Illuminated Chapter 1

## Introduction
This blog is my first computer science blog and I wanted something with the breadth of the entire field to serve as an introduction.

Before getting into the first chapter, I think it's a good idea to understand the background of the book before actually delving inside the content. The authors of this book are John Lewis (born: 25/08/1963) from Virgina Tech. 
Funnily from his Wikipedia page [[1]](#1), his Twitter account is mistaken for others' identities ranging from a British Department store to the American politician and civil rights leader. At the time of writing this he is an adjunct professor at Virginia Tech but using 
the 3rd edition textbook from my university, it states he is at Villanova University. Nell Dale is the other co-author and is part of the IEEE Computer Society and was one of the first women to get a PhD in Computer Science in the 1970s and graduated and taught at the University of Texas, Austin.
Both of these authors have written extensively on programming languages for education and Lewis actively participates in the __ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Eduction__ (SIGCSE) and Dale got an award from ACM SIGCSE in 1996.
